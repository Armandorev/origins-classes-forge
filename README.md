## Disclaimer
1. This is **NOT** an official port.
2. **DON'T** ask for backport, this mod depends on [EdwinMindcraft](https://github.com/EdwinMindcraft)'s [Forge port](https://github.com/EdwinMindcraft/origins-forge) for [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric), and most features needs some specific versions of that mod to work properly.
3. Most of the code were rewritten to fit forge environment and extend customizabilities, so keep in mind that some features may be slightly different from the fabric version.

## Contributing
1. For translation: **DON'T** simply copy translation from the fabric version. As what I mentioned in the disclaimer, some features are different, so always take en_us.json as your only reference.
2. For issues: Version information of Minecraft, Forge, Origins and Origins: Classes are mandatory for an issue, crash reports and logs are also important. Only with enough information can other contributors or me find and fix the problem.
3. For pull requests: I'm open to PRs. If you'd like to contribute with the mod, feel free to open a PR!
